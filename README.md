# BigWenDB
A large orthology database for identifying bilaterian-specific genes.

In this repository, we provide the source code scripts to run the part of the OrthoMCL pipeline (Li et al, 2003) that employs a MySQL database, within the statistical environment R. 
We provide further a script written in Perl that we used to determine orthogroup ancestors according to NCBI taxonomy. 
These files were generated for the paper "The genetic factors of bilaterian evolution" by Heger et al., 2019 (25-01-2019-RA-eLife-45530R1). 
Please note that the currently available versions of the code may not run smoothly on some systems. 
We are currently working on an updated version and improved documentation.
