# BigWenDB
A large orthology database to find bilaterian-specific genes

In this repository, we provide the source code scripts to run the OrthoMCL pipeline (Li et al, 2003) within the statistical environment R. 
We provide further a script written in Perl that we used to determine orthogroup ancestors according to NCBI taxonomy. 
These files were generated for the paper "The genetic factors of bilaterian evolution" by Heger et al., eLife xxy, 2019. 
Please note that the currently available version of the code may not run smoothly on some systems. 
We are currently working on an updated version and better documentation.
